# Employee Hours Analyzer (Streamlit)

This web app lets you:
1. Upload **Employee List Example** and **Payroll Example** (.xlsx).
2. Pick a preset **date window** that always runs from the **2nd of a month** through the **1st of the next month** (inclusive).
3. It finds employees (not Terminated/Resigned) whose **Start Date OR Rehire Date** falls in that window.
4. It filters the Payroll rows to ONLY those employees, computes **Total Hours = Reg H (e) + OT H (e) + DT H (e) + Non-Worked Hours (e)**, keeps only rows with **Total Hours â‰¥ 360**, and shows **#Emp, First Name, Last Name, Total Hours**.
5. Download the result as Excel.

## Run locally
